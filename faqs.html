							<p style="text-align: justify;" >Dubai has a rich history dating back thousands of years. The city's origins can be traced to the early 18th century when it was a small fishing and trading village. In the late 19th century, Dubai became an important trading port, with merchants from around the Arabian Gulf and as far away as India and East Africa conducting business there.</p>

                             <p style="text-align: justify;" >In 1971, Dubai joined with six other emirates to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a federal state that remains in place today. Since then, Dubai has undergone significant economic and cultural development, becoming one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Despite its modernization, Dubai has worked hard to preserve its cultural heritage and traditions, with landmarks such as the Dubai Museum and the Jumeirah Mosque showcasing the city's history and culture.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >The UAE, on the other hand, is known for its oil and gas reserves, which have played a significant role in the country's economic development over the years. While the country has diversified its economy in recent years, with a focus on sectors such as tourism and renewable energy, oil and gas remain major contributors to the UAE's GDP.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >In terms of government and politics, Dubai has its own government, which is responsible for managing local affairs such as transportation, infrastructure, and tourism.

Each emirate has its own ruler, who is also a member of the Federal Supreme Council, which is the highest legislative and executive body in the country.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >The official currency used in Dubai is the United Arab Emirates Dirham, which is abbreviated as AED or simply Dhs. The Dirham is further divided into 100 smaller units called fils. Coins come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 fils, as well as 1 Dirham. Banknotes come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 Dirhams.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >The Dirham has been pegged to the US dollar since 1978, with an exchange rate of 1 USD to 3.67 AED. This means that the value of the Dirham remains constant in relation to the US dollar, making it a stable currency for both locals and foreigners alike.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >When traveling to Dubai, it is recommended to exchange some of your home currency for Dirhams at a local exchange office or bank. Most hotels and tourist destinations also accept major credit cards such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. It is also worth noting that many establishments in Dubai, particularly in the more touristy areas, accept other major currencies such as the Euro and British Pound. However, it is always best to have some Dirhams on hand for smaller transactions or purchases at local markets.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Overall, the Dirham is a stable and widely accepted currency in Dubai, and visitors should have no problem exchanging their home currency or using their credit cards while in the city.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Dubai is known to be one of the most expensive cities in the world, with a relatively high cost of living. The cost of living in Dubai can vary greatly depending on a number of factors such as accommodation, transportation, food, and entertainment.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Accommodation is often the biggest expense for those living in Dubai. The cost of renting an apartment or house can vary widely depending on the location, size, and amenities of the property. It is common for expats to live in gated communities or apartment complexes that offer a range of amenities such as swimming pools, gyms, and security. The cost of rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center can range from 4,000 AED to 8,000 AED per month, while a three-bedroom apartment can cost between 10,000 AED to 18,000 AED per month.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Transportation costs in Dubai can also be significant, particularly if you own a car. While petrol is relatively inexpensive in Dubai, the cost of purchasing and maintaining a car can add up quickly. Public transportation options such as the Dubai Metro, buses, and taxis are widely available and can be a more affordable option for those on a budget.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Food and dining expenses in Dubai can vary depending on your preferences and dining choices. Dubai is known for its high-end dining options and luxury restaurants, which can be quite expensive. However, there are also plenty of affordable dining options such as local cafes and street food vendors. Grocery costs can also vary depending on the type of food you purchase, with imported goods often being more expensive than locally produced items.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Entertainment expenses in Dubai can also add up quickly. While there are plenty of free or low-cost activities to enjoy, such as visiting the beach or exploring local markets, other activities such as theme parks and water parks can be quite expensive.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Overall, the cost of living in Dubai can be high, but there are ways to live within your means and budget. It is important to carefully consider your expenses and prioritize your spending in order to make the most of your time in the city.</p>

However, in general, the cheapest months to visit Dubai are May, June, and September.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >During these months, the temperatures can be quite hot, with average highs ranging from 36°C to 41°C (96°F to 106°F), which may not be ideal for everyone. However, if you can handle the heat and humidity, you can take advantage of lower hotel rates and flight fares during these months.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >It's worth noting that the holy month of Ramadan can affect the availability of certain attractions and services, as well as the operating hours of some businesses. Therefore, if you plan to visit Dubai during Ramadan (which falls on different dates each year based on the lunar calendar), it's best to check in advance and plan accordingly.</p>

                            <h2>Dress Code in Public Places</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;" >In public places, such as malls, restaurants, and tourist attractions, it's recommended to dress modestly. For men, this means wearing t-shirts, shorts, or trousers, while for women, it's recommended to dress conservatively, with clothing that covers the shoulders, upper arms, and legs at least to the knee.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Tipping is not mandatory in Dubai, but it is generally expected in most service industries. Here are some general guidelines for tipping in Dubai:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Restaurants: Many restaurants in Dubai include a service charge on the bill, which is typically 10%. If a service charge is not included, it is customary to leave a tip of 10-15% of the total bill. Some high-end restaurants may add a service charge of 15-20%. It's always a good idea to check the bill to see if a service charge has been included.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Hotels: It is common to tip hotel staff in Dubai, including housekeeping, bellhops, and concierge. A tip of 10-20 dirhams per day is customary for housekeeping, and a tip of 20-50 dirhams is typical for bellhops who assist with luggage. If a concierge goes out of their way to assist with something, a tip of 50-100 dirhams is appropriate.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Taxis: Tipping taxi drivers in Dubai is not expected, but rounding up the fare to the nearest dirham is common practice.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Other services: Tipping for other services, such as hairdressers, spa treatments, and tour guides, is generally at your discretion. A tip of 10-15% of the total cost is common.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >It's worth noting that some restaurants and hotels may add a "discretionary" service charge, which is essentially a tip. If you feel that the service was not up to par, you can ask to have the service charge removed from your bill and leave a smaller tip or no tip at all.</p>

                            <li>Currency: The official currency of Dubai is the United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED). It's recommended to carry some local currency with you for expenses such as transportation, food, and souvenirs.</li>
                            <li>Suitable clothing: Dubai is a Muslim country, and it's important to dress modestly. Women should avoid wearing revealing clothing, and men should avoid wearing shorts in public places.</li>
                            <li>Sunscreen and sunglasses: Dubai is a sunny destination, and it's essential to protect your skin and eyes from the strong sun.</li>
                            <li>Adapters and chargers: Dubai uses a Type G plug, so make sure to bring an adapter if your electronics have a different plug type.</li>
                            <li>Medications: If you're taking any medications, make sure to bring enough for your entire trip and pack them in your carry-on bag.</li>

                                <li>Car rental: Renting a car is a popular option for those who want more flexibility and independence when exploring Dubai. Most major car rental companies have locations throughout the city, and driving is on the right side of the road.</li>
                                <li>Private transportation: Private transportation services such as Uber and Careem are available in Dubai and can be a convenient option for those who prefer not to use public transportation or taxis.</li>
                                <li>Walking and cycling: Dubai has many pedestrian-friendly areas, and walking or cycling can be a great way to explore the city, especially in areas like Dubai Marina and Jumeirah Beach.</li>
